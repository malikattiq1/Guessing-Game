	About the classes that are in the project

first I am going to tell you that I have to take three classes:

main.java

palyer.java

guessgame.java

I put all my code that is responsible for the generation of random number and stuff like that in the class name guess game.java.im made a player class for a player and main class where I just call the function start game(), and the game is started
